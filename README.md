# PSMove-Clicker
 
## Not so fun facts

This repository has:

- ugly code
- stolen binaries (i don't even know what version are they), btw can someone tell me how to build psmoveservice from source, thank you
- probably memory leaks, but who cares anyways
- bad ui
- polish language (TODO - english translation)

Oh and it only (somehow) works on Windows
